Augmented Reality with Speech to Text features for Android platform

Should be able to start up by cloning the repo and running it through Android Studio.

Please use a physical phone to run the app, not an emulator. (unless you have configured your emulator to have access to your computer's camera)

Simply point the camera toward your face and there will be a blue dot following your mouth. Then speak to the device
and your speech will be translated to text shown on your mouth. 
(Works better in quiet areas with stable internet connections)


I am open to any suggestions, optimizations, bugs, or issues with Google credentials. Feel free to play around.

3D graphics will be uploaded and intergrated once I stabilize mouth detection abit more. Stay Tuned!
