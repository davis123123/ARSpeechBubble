Augmented Reality with Speech to Text features for Android platform

Should be able to start up by cloning the repo and running it through Android Studio.

Please use a physical phone to run the app, not an emulator. (unless you have configured your emulator to have access to your computer's camera)

I am open to any suggestions, optimizations, bugs, or issues with Google credentials. Feel free to play around.

3D graphics will be uploaded and intergrated once I stabilize mouth detection abit more. Stay Tuned!
