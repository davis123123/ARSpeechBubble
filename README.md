# ARSpeechBubble
Augmented Reality with Speech to Text features for Android platform

Should be able to start up by cloning the repo and running it through Android Studio.

Set Up to Authenticate With Your Project's Credentials:
This Android app uses JSON credential file locally stored in the resources.

In order to try out this app, visit the Cloud Console, and navigate to: API Manager > Credentials > Create credentials > Service account key > New service account. Create a new service account, and download the JSON credentials file. Put the file in the app resources as app/src/main/res/raw/credential.json.

Please use a physical phone to run the app, not an emulator. (unless you have configured your emulator to have access to your computer's camera)

Simply point the camera toward your face and there will be a blue dot following your mouth. Then speak to the device
and your speech will be translated to text shown on your mouth. 
(Works better in quiet areas with stable internet connections)


I am open to any suggestions, optimizations, bugs, or issues with Google credentials. Feel free to play around.

3D graphics will be uploaded and intergrated once I stabilize mouth detection abit more. Stay Tuned!
